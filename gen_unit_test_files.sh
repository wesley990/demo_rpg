# Uses find to recursively search for all .dart files in the lib directory.
# For each file found, it:
# a. Extracts the relative path within the lib directory.
# b. Constructs the corresponding test file path in the test directory.
# c. Determines the directory for the test file.
# d. If the test file doesn't exist, it creates the necessary directories and the empty test file.
